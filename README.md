## API repository: [GeekBudget.Api](https://github.com/minajevs/GeekBudget.Api)

## Info
GeekBudget is budget tracker for geeks (hence the name). It is focused on transparency, ease-of-use and extensibility. This repository contains official web client for GeekBudget API.

There is no bussines logic in this client. It fully relies on GeekBudget.Api. Offline version of the website is available (thanks to service workers), however it does not cache data, so there will be no functionality. 

Client designed to work serverless (as a static page). Currently test version is hosted on GitHub pages.

## Warning
This project is under **heavy** development. There is first alpha-version upcoming soon. Stay tuned.
